   <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Mother&amp;#8217;s Day and Manny Ramirez&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The following is a reproduciton of a piece I wrote for an old blog.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mother passed away in 2002 of cancer, but that’s not the point of this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was a huge baseball fan, and she’s really the reason I obsess over the game. A fire destroyed my childhood home while I was in college, taking with it most family photos and even her ashes. All I have left are some of her old vinyl records and the box scores of great seasons of baseball etched into history, vivid memories forever encoded as a series of statistical footnotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She, like most Minnesotans, was a Twins fan. But she followed the Cubs and Braves pretty religiously, too, because they could always be counted on for a televised day game. She’d watch hundreds of games each season. If it was on television, she watched it, knitting and screaming at the umpires at the same time. She knew the sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She loved the game so much, she’s the only person I know who actually religiously followed the season after the player strike canceled the World Series in ‘94. Some say they never lost faith, but they’re mostly liars. I didn’t understand her reasons at the time. I hated baseball so much, I didn’t even like my little league team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day she scolded me for reasons I can’t remember. I was young, first or second grade, and devastated. My mom must have felt pretty bad because later that night she gave me a pack of baseball cards and I pulled out a Kirby Puckett card. The card was probably worthless to any collector, but it’s one of the most important memories I have about her. She believed in forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder what she would have thought about Manny Ramirez’s recent 50-game suspension from baseball for using performance enhancing drugs. Or my childhood hero Barry Bonds’ fall from grace. Or about Sammy Sosa’s corked bat. (I’m glad she wasn’t alive for that moment, or for the now painfully obvious suspicion that the ‘98 derby was a juiced-up freak show. She loved Sosa for his race to 60+ home runs with Mark McGwire and his subsequent 60+ home run seasons, because it returned fans, still bruised and scarred from the strike, to the seats). Maybe she had her suspicions and just kept them from me, but I doubt it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Game 2 of the 1991 World Series, Kent Hrbek, the Twins first baseman lifted the Braves’ Ron Gant off first base and applied a tag. Gant was called out, because Hrbek blocked umpire Drew Coble’s line of sight. Anyone watching from home saw the angle from the third base camera. The cheat was obvious. I’ll never forget the look on my mother’s face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She didn’t try to defend and explain away Hrbek like many Twins fans did at the time (most have fully recovered and admit it now). A cheat is a cheat. The Twins won the game by one run. They didn’t deserve the win, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when Puckett sent a walk off home run in the 11th inning of Game 6, smile ear to ear and fist pumped high as he circled the bases and when, in Game 7, Jack Morris shut out the Braves in 10 straight innings, I don’t think mom was as happy as she could have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That baseball is held to a higher standard than other sports when it comes to steroids shouldn’t come as a surprise. The myth of baseball has always been one of redemption. When the scars heal, they remind us why the game is beautiful. The game is only perfect in our memories. That we wish it to be perfect in reality, too, is what sets this sport apart from all others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Mother’s Day.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>On Long Form Writing</title>
   <link href="http://al3x.net/2012/05/01/Long-Form.html"/>
   <updated>2012-05-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://al3x.net/2012/05/01/Long-Form</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;On Long Form Writing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I used to blog about technology and journalism. I did it fairly regularly and, to my surprise, gained a sizeable readership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started with me working out some problems in my head. Problems like, why don&amp;#8217;t newsrooms understand this newfangled Internet thing? What are the fundamentals of the newspaper business (and the newspaper culture) that keep it from moving head first into new technology?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t really write in ways that people would considering &lt;em&gt;blogging&lt;/em&gt;. I didn&amp;#8217;t even consider my blog a blog in the traditional sense of the word, either. Itwas a place where I wrote essays. Sometimes very, very long essays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped writing that blog because one day, as I was paying my hosting bill, I realized that I didn&amp;#8217;t really have much to say on the matter anymore, so I shut down the site. The things I was writing about had changed dramatically, and there were so many people in the space parroting each other, I just figured I didn&amp;#8217;t need to go on and on about the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; If we read of one man robbed, or murdered, or killed by accident, or one house burned, or one vessel wrecked, or one steamboat blown up, or one cow run over on the Western railroad, or one mad dog killed, or one lot of grasshoppers in the winter — we need never read of another. One is enough. If you are acquainted with the principle, what do you care for a myriad of instances and applications?&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; Henry David Thoreau, &lt;strong&gt;Walden&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I&amp;#8217;ve mostly kept my public thoughts to my twitter account. Those thoughts are mostly ultra-short-form rants about things I obsess over: mushrooms, baseball, maths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve noticed something about my feelings toward twitter lately, and really, blogging in general, that swings me back to the curmudgeony stereotype I used to rail against with the curmudgeony types in newsrooms. Where is the substance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, unlike your typical curmudgeon, I&amp;#8217;m not going to conflate the technology of blogging with trends in practice, but every time I see a tweet to a post like &amp;#8220;5 things every small business should know about Pinterest&amp;#8221; I want to gouge my eyes out. Pinterest is a fine subject to discuss. As are small businesses. As are Things You Should Know. I find myself yearning for depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m subscribed to several magazines, those that still value a long-form piece of journalism and analysis or two in their rags, anyway. I get the point of the list, that bastard of a journalistic ploy to get you to take five seconds out of your life to read about something interesting. However, when everyone scrambles for five more seconds of your time, and you keep giving them five more seconds, what have you really learned? There are 12 five-second segments in a minute, 720 in an hour and 17,280 in a day. If all you do with that time is scratch and surfaces, is that time well spent? I think not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;To a philosopher all news, as it is called, is gossip, and they who edit and read it are old women over their tea. Yet not a few are greedy after this gossip. There was such a rush, as I hear, the other day at one of the offices to learn the foreign news by the last arrival, that several large squares of plate glass belonging to the establishment were broken by the pressure &amp;#8212; news which I seriously think a ready wit might write a twelve-month, or twelve years, beforehand with sufficient accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it fascinating how in times of panic, after immediate safety needs are met, people want information. During the great San Francisco fire, there were reports of news carts destroyed by people rushing for the news. I think of myself during 9/11 and how I was entirely glued to every media source available. Yet, at its earliest, information that looks truthy can be very falsy and nobody really knows. So there&amp;#8217;s this massive desire for what is essentially garbage. It&amp;#8217;s not until we step back and reflect on the bigger picture can we really, truly begin to understand anything. It&amp;#8217;s like reaching for a candy bar instead of waiting for the apple to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder what Henry would think now.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Reasonable Defaults for Programmers</title>
   <link href="http://al3x.net/2012/04/03/Reasonable-Defaults.html"/>
   <updated>2012-04-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://al3x.net/2012/04/03/Reasonable-Defaults</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Reasonable Defaults for Programmers&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s well known that all programmers hate all other programmer&amp;#8217;s code.&lt;br /&gt;
Given sufficient time, all programmers also eventually begin to hate&lt;br /&gt;
their own code. This is life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a particular attitude among haters of other people&amp;#8217;s code.&lt;br /&gt;
A programmer believes his or her standard of writing code is&lt;br /&gt;
best. They use unit tests or some new design pattern or whatever makes&lt;br /&gt;
them feel special or better than lesser programmers. They actively pick&lt;br /&gt;
out the flaws of the code written by others. To them, the world should&lt;br /&gt;
be defaulted to their standards, and when they find it is not, they&lt;br /&gt;
become assholes to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have spent some time wondering what causes this unreasonable default&lt;br /&gt;
behavior. Why, instead of working to improve ones self and ones team and&lt;br /&gt;
ones community, is it so often easier to merely point to flaws?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not the first to notice this phenomena by any means. The Buddha&amp;#8217;s&lt;br /&gt;
first discourse describes it in the first two Noble Truths:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first Noble Truth of dukkha: There is a basic unsatisfactoriness&lt;br /&gt;
pervading all existence, in all forms of life. Some Westerners call this&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8220;suffering&amp;#8221; but it covers more surface area than that. All things are&lt;br /&gt;
constantly in motion. Constantly changing. Constantly causing friction.&lt;br /&gt;
Before we acknowledge the second truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second Noble Truth is the origin of dukkha: We are conditioned by&lt;br /&gt;
ignorance to seek out objects and experience that cause pleasure, to&lt;br /&gt;
dominate and control and manipulate our world and to avoid painful&lt;br /&gt;
situations. The objects of our attachment are transient things.&lt;br /&gt;
Eventually they will lose their luster and suffering will follow. We&lt;br /&gt;
delude ourselves into thinking we are singular beings, islands removed&lt;br /&gt;
from the rest of humanity, the rest of life. This delusion ignores the&lt;br /&gt;
truth that we are all merely part of a continuing universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is a way out of the woods, I would think. And it comes through&lt;br /&gt;
dispassion. Some have said it&amp;#8217;s as simple as &amp;#8220;give it five minutes.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third Noble Truth is the truth that the cessation of dukkha is&lt;br /&gt;
ultimately attainable. We can cease suffering. The Buddhists call this&lt;br /&gt;
nirodha, which is the unmaking of craving and attachment. We can attain&lt;br /&gt;
nirvana through dispassion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth Noble Truth is the cessation of dukkha. Through a gradual&lt;br /&gt;
path of self-improvement, described as the Eightfold Path, we can mind&lt;br /&gt;
the middle path between self-indulgence and self-mortification.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>eBook User Experience</title>
   <link href="http://al3x.net/2012/03/07/Ebooks.html"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;eBook User Experience&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often say that if I become a millionaire, I am going to have a library filled with Kindles. Each one is going to have a single book on it. And I&amp;#8217;ll hire a librarian for this private library, too. Because books aren&amp;#8217;t meant to be merely read. They&amp;#8217;re meant to be admired. They&amp;#8217;re meant to show off to your friends and your enemies. They&amp;#8217;re meant to remind you, every day, how you would read that copy of &lt;em&gt;Plato&amp;#8217;s Republic&lt;/em&gt; featured prominently in your living room if it weren&amp;#8217;t featured so prominently in your living room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s what&amp;#8217;s missing from the Kindle. How does one subtly announce to the world they&amp;#8217;re reading &lt;em&gt;Infinite Jest&lt;/em&gt; for the fourth time? How do fellow readers-cum-passers-by judge perfect-strangers-cum-public-readers in a park or at the beach?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh but Kindle ownership is itself a statement of status you say? Bullshit. Kindles are cheap and if you want credit for pretending to read War and Peace, you have to earn it by lugging that thing everywhere for a summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much has been said about how a book distributes its weight in your hand. How it smells like victory when you buy it new, flip through it, and put it prominently on your living room bookcase. When I see a Kindle at someone&amp;#8217;s house, I don&amp;#8217;t think &amp;#8220;oh, he&amp;#8217;s pretending to be well read, too.&amp;#8221; I think, &amp;#8220;I bet that thing is full of romance novels and the Twighlight series.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#8217;s why I&amp;#8217;ve decided to add something to my plan as a millionaire. I&amp;#8217;m going to hire artists to paint the cover of each book on the back of each Kindle in my library. That way, people will know just how dedicated I am to this particular farce.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <updated>2012-02-28T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://al3x.net/2012/02/28/Brett</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Brett&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Get it done,&amp;#8221; he&amp;#8217;d snarl. He scared the shit out of new kids in the control room. We used to fuck with them. Tell them Brett got it in prison. College kids working in a small market TV station would believe anything. Sometimes the dumbest of them believed people lived in the satellites. But nobody would question what we said about Brett. They&amp;#8217;d just nod and let Brett be intimidating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He intimidated me at first, too. That scar. The case of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;TAB&lt;/span&gt; in the break room fridge. Who in the Hell drinks &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;TAB&lt;/span&gt;? Psychos who&amp;#8217;ve been to prison, that&amp;#8217;s who. His body hung on a wiry frame. His brow always furrowed. His eyes could pierce through the dark control rooms. His voice. That raspy voice. That scar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Get it done.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He showed me how to do everything in the first segment and then he hovered over me as I fucked everything up in the second. This was live TV. He stood over me and let me fuck up, even as the director plead with him to step in and fix it. Everybody will fuck up in live TV. That was his first lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that lesson cascaded into a second: don&amp;#8217;t expect help. Cascaded into a third: move foward. And a fourth: to learn success, you must fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me it was the worst job I&amp;#8217;d ever done. To him it was just one of the 365 10 p.m. newscasts that year. The fifth lesson: be excellent, but nobody is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning I found a two-page-long list of things I&amp;#8217;d done wrong in my locker. He took the time to review my failure. I should have kept my hands on the board. I have should thought ahead a few steps. I should have listen to the director. I should have calmed down when things got bad and just fixed the problem and moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made mistakes after that day. Everybody did at some point. But I got better at recognizing why I made mistakes. This is important. This was the sixth lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the few short years I worked with Brett, I learned he wasn&amp;#8217;t so scary. Quite the opposite. He thought it was funny people thought he was intimidating, but he let people think what they wanted to think. After awhile those eyes didn&amp;#8217;t pierce anymore. He was working on an idea for a children&amp;#8217;s book. He talked about it all the time. His eyes would widen and you could just see into him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He exploded with joy at perfection, when done was gotten without incident. Fist would pump. He&amp;#8217;d whoop and holler. He&amp;#8217;d rub his hands together. Grin ear to ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was told Brett had died, I was at work. New job. Hadn&amp;#8217;t been at the station in years. Hadn&amp;#8217;t spoken to Brett in since I left the station. Still, it was the kind of news that hit me too hard, too fast. I left the office for the afternoon. Made up some excuse. Spent some time walking. Walking and bawling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s hard to describe how one person could influence my professional career, in a field I&amp;#8217;m no longer working in, no less. But that was Brett. I think about him a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I knew him better, but I didn&amp;#8217;t. The path to perfection is littered with imperfection. Sometimes you just have to pay your respects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Everybody fucks up.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t expect help.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Move forward.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;To learn success, you must fail.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Be excellent, but nobody is perfect.&lt;/li&gt;
