<h1>Reasonable Defaults for Programmers</h1>
<p>It&#8217;s well known that all programmers hate all other programmer&#8217;s code.<br />
Given sufficient time, all programmers also eventually begin to hate<br />
their own code. This is life.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a particular attitude among haters of other people&#8217;s code.<br />
A programmer believes his or her standard of writing code is<br />
best. They use unit tests or some new design pattern or whatever makes<br />
them feel special or better than lesser programmers. They actively pick<br />
out the flaws of the code written by others. To them, the world should<br />
be defaulted to their standards, and when they find it is not, they<br />
become assholes to the world.</p>
<p>I have spent some time wondering what causes this unreasonable default<br />
behavior. Why, instead of working to improve ones self and ones team and<br />
ones community, is it so often easier to merely point to flaws?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not the first to notice this phenomena by any means. The Buddha&#8217;s<br />
first discourse describes it in the first two Noble Truths:</p>
<p>The first Noble Truth of dukkha: There is a basic unsatisfactoriness<br />
pervading all existence, in all forms of life. Some Westerners call this<br />
&#8220;suffering&#8221; but it covers more surface area than that. All things are<br />
constantly in motion. Constantly changing. Constantly causing friction.<br />
Before we acknowledge the second truth.</p>
<p>The second Noble Truth is the origin of dukkha: We are conditioned by<br />
ignorance to seek out objects and experience that cause pleasure, to<br />
dominate and control and manipulate our world and to avoid painful<br />
situations. The objects of our attachment are transient things.<br />
Eventually they will lose their luster and suffering will follow. We<br />
delude ourselves into thinking we are singular beings, islands removed<br />
from the rest of humanity, the rest of life. This delusion ignores the<br />
truth that we are all merely part of a continuing universe.</p>
<p>But there is a way out of the woods, I would think. And it comes through<br />
dispassion. Some have said it&#8217;s as simple as &#8220;give it five minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The third Noble Truth is the truth that the cessation of dukkha is<br />
ultimately attainable. We can cease suffering. The Buddhists call this<br />
nirodha, which is the unmaking of craving and attachment. We can attain<br />
nirvana through dispassion.</p>
<p>The fourth Noble Truth is the cessation of dukkha. Through a gradual<br />
path of self-improvement, described as the Eightfold Path, we can mind<br />
the middle path between self-indulgence and self-mortification.</p>
